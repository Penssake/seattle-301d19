# Student Feedback: Week 1

## Least Helpful

- I thought this week was much better constructed than week one of the 201 course. I do think that the "pair program everything" aspect needs a little bit more thought. When all we are doing for an assignment is adding 6-8 lines of code, it's a little silly to expect commits from both partners. It just comes across as busy work at times.
- I am not big on the pair programming, because sometimes it feels like two students, who know equally as little, are working together to figure out what the solution is. Sometimes it works well, and sometimes it's just two people staring at each other.
- Least helpful is the time in which we are given to complete assignments versus the amount of assignments due daily/weekly. Assignment due dates and times are changed without notice. One day, pair-programming lab work will be due at 11:59am and the next 12:59pm. This inconsistency makes it hard to 'plan' your day in terms of working on your assignments.
- Canvas is hard to follow with the code review/lecture moving to the afternoons. Reading assignments are now due the day after the lecture on those topics. The class name of the canvas assignments are easy to mistake for the due date. I like some things about the lecture being moved back, and dislike others.
- It's all been helpful but I feel like I am struggling to figure out how to solve these problems without referencing previous code or asking TA's often.
- Data Structures

## Most Helpful

- The most helpful thing this week has been code review and taking the time to test out different theories of ways to make code work. Nick is always willing to test any code out even if it doesn't run or we have to spend some time as a class debugging it.
- I really enjoyed the addition of the data structures work.
- I LOVE GROUP STUFF!!! Even if the other person and I aren't that great at writing the code. Having your partner just to even ask the question out loud can reveal your answer. Plus if you both don't get it then I don't feel like the black sheep out who doesn't get it. It its a weird way to look for encouragement but knowing that drops the fear to actually ask for help.
- Code review.
- The instructor and TAs are available and helpful when needed. The extra pair programming for data structures has been good.
- Code review, QA
- Most helpful are the TAs being available and actually help work through coding issues with you. This helps to better understand why something is working or not working.
- The most helpful aspects of the course that I have found are the constant help and feedback from the TA's they are very patient and kind.
- Instructor, TAs, and classmates willing to assist when I'm stuck.
- Everything has been helpful but code review has saved me pretty big at least once this week.

## Other Comments

- Is there any chance we can get more machine learning or robotics speakers or demos for power hour or lunch-n-learn? Not to say that I don't enjoy writing code obviously but to make things physically operate outside of my web browser is very gratifying. Like I've been testing with an object identification camera and it uses javascript and python. Both to which are very applicable to all the students at Code Fellows. Other then that, I LOVE THIS PLACE!
