# Write a Technical Blog Post

In this series of assignments, you will be writing a blog post to share something you have learned with those who may be interested in following a similar path.

## Create a Medium Account for your Blog

This first step is very simple: create an account on the popular blog site Medium! Get your username and a picture of you in there, as well as a short bio of yourself. You may want to turn off any emails from Medium so that you don't get spammed, but that's up to you.

## Brainstorm for Your Technical Blog Post

This next step will have you thinking about the topics that might be of interest to you. You don't have to do too much work here: brainstorm at least 3 technical topics that interest you.

"Technical" means "relating to technology". Does some JavaScript framework interest you? Write about that. Maybe you have your eyes set on a specific career path in tech. Write about that career path and why it interests you, as well as what their responsibilities and what types of companies employ that type of career. Maybe you write in a language other than JavaScript (like Rust, C++, Go, etc...). Write about that. Maybe you're really into databases. Write about those. Game design? Write about it!

Unsure if your ideas will pass the "technical" test? Bring them to me (or the TAs) and ask!

## Outline Your Technical Blog Post

Pick a topic from the list you generated (or one that came to mind since then). Think about how you might want to explain your topic to someone with a similar level of experience that you had at the beginning of your time at Code Fellows.

Outline your post with as much detail as you can. Use an outlining tool like [Workflowy.com](https://workflowy.com/), or a mind-mapping program (like [Maptini.com](http://maptini.com/) or [Mind Node](https://mindnode.com/)), or just write it up in a private file at gist.github.com or a document in google drive.

## Publish Your Technical Blog Post

Using your outline, write at least 500 words about your chosen topic. If you reference something else (documentation, other blog posts), include those references in text. Somewhere within your blog post, have a code snippet that we can read through that pertains to the topic you've picked.

Get some peer-feedback by asking your classmates and others to review your post. Polish up your blog post for final publishing. Double-check for grammar and spelling errors. Ensure code examples are nicely syntax-highlighted. Read it out loud at least once.
